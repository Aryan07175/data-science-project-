Movie Rating Prediction Model
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates the application of clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering) on a dataset to uncover hidden patterns and groupings. It is part of Week 7 coursework for a data science or machine learning module.

ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary
The dataset used contains 15,509 movie records with the following columns:
Name, Year, Duration, Genre, Rating, Votes, Director, Actor 1, Actor 2, Actor 3.

Missing Data Insight:

Rating is available for only ~51% of the records.

Duration is missing in more than half the dataset.

Sample Entries:

Name	Year	Genre	Rating	Votes
#Gadhvi (He thought he was Gandhi)	2019	Drama	7.0	8
#Yaaram	2019	Comedy, Romance	4.4	35
...Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya	1997	Comedy, Drama, Musical	4.7	827
...Yahaan	2005	Drama, Romance, War	7.4	1086

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Unnecessary or missing entries were removed.

Non-numeric values in Votes and Year were cleaned and converted to appropriate types.

Visualizations Created:

Genre distribution plot.

Ratings histogram.

Correlation heatmaps for numeric features.

Figures generated include:

Distribution of movies across genres.

Ratings vs. Votes scatter plot.

Heatmap showing correlations among features like Rating and Votes.
